[HMDA](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda) is the CFPB's first dataset to publish using [Qu](http://cfpb.github.io/qu/), an in-progress data platform created to serve public data.

Qu is the first CFPB project built from the beginning on [GitHub](https://github.com/cfpb/), too. If you think you can make the API better–or just want to take a look under the hood–check it out, and learn about how you can host your own datasets or contribute to the project.
